# Advent-of-Code-2024
This year I'm trying to re-learn Java, which I haven't touched since school.

Last year, I drew my cover art in MS Paint, but didn't care for the result. This year I outsourced the artwork to ChatGPT's DALL-E.

The confusing part has been figuring out how to structure a package. Under the
current arrangement, this will at least compile and run:
```
make
cd bin/
java aoc24.Main
```

## TODO
* [] find a tool to clean up imports
* [] linting
* [] tests... don't want to install an IDE just for unit test compatibility

For reasons I don't yet understand, you can't just run `java bin.aoc24.Main` from the top-level directory.
